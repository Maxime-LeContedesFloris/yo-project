# Hello world!

Hey, I now have a blog! I'll post things about programming and technology on it. So you can expect both tutorials on whatever technologies I'm playing with at the moment and sometimes, more "classic" articles where I just share my opinion on a given topic (but still tech-related).

But the main goal here, remains to share the knowledge I've acquired during all these days I spent reading stuff on the web and trying to solve problems I encountered (I'm talking to you BSOD...). In other words, it's a way to give back to the community. Plus, writing about something forces me to understand the topic better.

Since I intent to keep this blog as lightweight as possible, and that I'm not satisfied with Disqus-like comments system, you won't have the possibility to post comments. But, feel free to email/tweet me your questions or remarks!

See you around!
