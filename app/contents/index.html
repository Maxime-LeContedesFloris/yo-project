  <h1 class="mb2 mt0 h1">Hello</h1>
  <p>
    My name is Maxime Le Conte des Floris. I'm a web developer and open source enthusiast located in <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=12/44.8299/-0.6183">Bordeaux, France</a>.
  </p>
	<p>
		I'm also a student in Computer Science at the Bordeaux University Institute of Technology. Prior to that, I obtained a 2-year degree in Electrical Engineering but it wasn't really my thing and in the meantime, my interest for computing had grown to become a passion. So after one year as a self-taught, learning all I could about front-end developement, I decided to study Computer Science. And here I am!
	</p>
	<p>Currently, I tend to spend most of my free time building things using CSS & JavaScript (ES6/Node.js), playing with new tools (PostCSS/Gulp) and reading about UX & performance on the web.
	</p>
	<p>
		Oh and I almost forgot: I love Linux.
