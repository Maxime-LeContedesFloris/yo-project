title: About
---

<p>
  My name is Maxime Le Conte des Floris and I'm a software developer
  living in <a
  href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/search?query=Bordeaux">Bordeaux,
  France</a> with a deep passion for the open web.
</p>

<p>
  Almost 3 years ago, after graduating from Associate Degree in Electronics, I
  fell in love with the web and the spirit of open source. I spent a year
  learning all I could about front-end development. Then I got an Associate
  Degree in Computer Science and I'm currently studying Web Development and
  Digital Innovation at the Bordeaux University Institute of Technology (until
  sept 2017).
</p>

<p>
  I code mostly in JavaScript &mdash; I love this language. I
  find it to be extremely powerful and versatile yet easy to use with an awesome
  ecosystem. I also like Python very much as it emphasize readabily and
  programmer efficiency. As a web developer, I'm pretty fluent in CSS too.
</p>

<p>
  I've written quite a lot of Java (on the server) as part of my internship and
  a bit of C# while making video games with Unity. Finally, I recently started
  taking a look at Golang.
</p>

<p>
  Besides that, I'm a big cinema lover &mdash; with a watchlist of nearly 1,000
  movies because I can't find the time to watch them! &mdash; and I like
  photography even though I'm kind of a newbie in that field. You can find
  photos I'm proud enough to share on <a
