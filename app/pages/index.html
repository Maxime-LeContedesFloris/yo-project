        <p>Hide and seek (a cube) and quiz game in augmented reality.</p>

        <p>It was made as part of a 4 days-long project at school with 4 others students, and the goal was to build something for the Hololens.</p>

      <div>
        <p>Interactive story playable from your browser (on desktop) where you have to "conquer" the world with your computer worn.</p>

        <p>Made as part of a project for the jQuey courses at school, it's a small front-end making AJAX calls to a tiny Node.js API delivering the bits of the story &ndash; which are stored in a big json object on the server.</p>

      <div class="project__name">Ikarauraga</div>
      <div>
        <p>2D space shooter inspired by arcade shump games made with a friend (also developer) for Ludum Dare 35 using Unity.</p>

        <p>The theme of this Ludum Dare was "shapeshift". We had a great initial idea involving a spacecraft evolving throught the history of aviation, but without a graphic designer, it was impossible to make. So we keeped the spacecraft idea, and settled for a classic space shooter.</p>

        <p>Nevertheless, we're pretty happy with the result given that we managed to make a complete game (with a soundtrack and all) while being total noob regarding game development.
