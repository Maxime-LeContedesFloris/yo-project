<h2 class="page__title">About me</h2>

My name is Maxime Le Conte des Floris and I'm a web developer / student living in Bordeaux, France.

I'm currently studying Web Development and Digital Innovation at the Bordeaux University Institute of Technology. My languages of choice are JavaScript and Python but I can find my way around others as well. I plan on taking a serious look at Rust too.

My main coding station is a custom config (running Ubuntu 16.10) I built a few years ago and when I'm on the go, I use a Dell XPS 13 (on Mint 18).

Beside that, I especially enjoy movies (sci-fi & thrillers).
