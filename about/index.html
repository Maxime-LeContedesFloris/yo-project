  My name is Maxime Le Conte des Floris and I'm a web developer / student living in <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/search?query=Bordeaux">Bordeaux, France</a> and I'm passionate about performance and accessibility on the web.

  2 years ago, after graduating from Associate Degree in Electronics, I fell in love with the web and the spirit of open source. I spent a year learning all I could about front-end development. Then I got an Associate Degree in Computer Science and I'm currently studying Web Development and Digital Innovation at the Bordeaux University Institute of Technology.

  I code mostly in JavaScript. I love the language and I'm so used to its ecosystem that using other languages often is quite fustrating. I also like Python a lot, which I use for scripting when things are to complex to be done in Bash. I plan on taking a serious look at either Rust or Go (not sure which one yet!).

  I've been using Linux as my main OS both on my desktop (running Elementary OS then Ubuntu) and on my Dell XPS 13 (running Linux Mint) for the past year and a half and I couldn't be happier.
