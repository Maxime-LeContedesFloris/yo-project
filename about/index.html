<h2 class="page__title">About me</h2>

<p>
  My name is Maxime Le Conte des Floris and I'm a web developer / student living in Bordeaux, France.
</p>


<p>
  I'm currently studying Web Development and Digital Innovation at the Bordeaux University Institute of Technology. My languages of choice are JavaScript and Python but I can find my way around others as well. I plan on taking a serious look at Rust too.
