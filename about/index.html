  My name is Maxime Le Conte des Floris and I'm a web developer / student living in <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/search?query=Bordeaux">Bordeaux, France</a> and I'm passionate about performance and accessibility on the web.
</p>

<p>
  Almost 3 years ago, after graduating from Associate Degree in Electronics, I fell in love with the web and the spirit of open source. I spent a year learning all I could about front-end development. Then I got an Associate Degree in Computer Science and I'm currently studying Web Development and Digital Innovation at the Bordeaux University Institute of Technology.

  I code mostly in JavaScript and Python &mdash; I love those two languages. I find the former to be very powerful yet easy to use with an awesome ecosystem (despite what a lot of people think about the current state of the JS ecosystem) and the latter to be extremely convenient and readable. As a web developer, I'm also pretty fluent in CSS.

<p>I've written quite a lot of Java (on the server) as part of my internship and a bit of C# while making video games (with Unity). Finally, I recently started taking a look at Golang.</p>

  As a Linux user, here's the obligatory "I use linux" part. Since the summer 2015, my desktop and my laptop run on Linux. I've played with a lot of distros (all Debian-based though), from ElementaryOS, to Ubuntu then Debian and Mint back to ElementaryOS and I'm still looking for the distro/DE that fits me the most!

<p>Besides that, I'm a big cinema lover &mdash; with a watchlist of almost 1,000 movies because I can't find the time to watch them! &mdash; and I like photography even though I'm kind of a newbie in that field. You can find photos I'm proud enough to share on <a href="https://unsplash.com/mlcdf">Unsplash</a>.
