title: About
---

My name is Maxime Le Conte des Floris and I'm a software developer
living in [Bordeaux, France](https://www.openstreetmap.org/search?query=Bordeaux)
with a deep passion for the open web.

After graduating from Associate Degree in Electronics, I
fell in love with the web and the spirit of open source. I spent a year
learning all I could about front-end development. Then I got an Associate
Degree in Computer Science and I'm currently studying Web Development and
Digital Innovation at the Bordeaux University Institute of Technology (until sept
2017)

I code mostly in JavaScript &mdash; I love this language. I
find it to be extremely powerful and versatile yet easy to use with an awesome
ecosystem. I also like Python very much as it emphasize readabily and
programmer efficiency. As a web developer, I'm pretty fluent in CSS too.

I've written quite a lot of Java (on the server) as part of my internship and
a bit of C# while making video games with Unity. Finally, I recently started
taking a look at Golang.

Besides that, I'm a big cinema lover &mdash; with a watchlist of nearly 1,000
movies because I can't find the time to watch them! &mdash; and I like
photography even though I'm kind of a newbie in that field. You can find
photos I'm proud enough to share on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/mlcdf).
